NAT GATEWAY

1.The main moto of every company is to make their data secure.
  In order to do so they should secure their database server.
2.IN the diagram we have two subnets...one is Private subnet(Database server)
  and the other is Public subnet(management server)
3.If we put both the servers in one subnet only, then the database server 
  will be directly connected to the external world,bcz it is directly connected 
  to igw
4.so put the database server in other subnet such that no one can access the data.
5.If in case if database server need to download any applications that it requires it
  is connected to NAT GATEWAY..via EIP and through the public subnet to igw and to the google.
  It is connected in this process and it downloads its required application.
6.In order to enter into the database server we cannot directly login into the dataserver,
  in order to do so
  we first login to management server and from their if you ping data server it responds                
  but couldnot download any application,bcz it requires a key to login .
    ______ HOW TO CREATE A KEY_________
7.from management server 
  ssh ec2-user@ip of database
 here we took 10.5.5.100
  
  * ssh ec2-user@10.5.5.100

Now here it asks for key then
 
  * nano mykey.pem
        paste the key
        cntrl + o ----> enter -----> cntrl + x
  
  * ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@10.5.5.100

  now it shows accesss denied .plz be secure about the key.
  then in order to make secure of your key 
  
  * chmod 400 mykey.pem

  * ll

  * ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@10.5.5.100

  now prompt shifts to 10.5.5.100 form 10.5.1.100

  now ping google from 10.5.5.100 now it works.
